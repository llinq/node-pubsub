# Base Guidelines

## Code Standards

### Language
- All code must be written in English
- Variable names, function names, class names, types, and interfaces must be in English
- Error messages, log messages, and API responses must be in English
- Documentation and comments (when necessary) must be in English

### Comments
- Avoid comments whenever possible
- Write self-documenting code with clear, descriptive names
- If a comment is necessary, it means the code should be refactored
- Exception: Complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic may require brief explanations

### Formatting
- Do not use emojis in code, comments, or log messages
- Keep console.log messages clean and professional
- Use consistent formatting following the project's style

### Code Quality
- Prefer clear, descriptive names over comments
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript types effectively to document expected data structures
- Write code that explains itself through structure and naming
